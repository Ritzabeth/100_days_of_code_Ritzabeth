# 100_days_of_code_Ritzabeth
A public log of my daily coding journey — 100 days of consistent practice, learning and building. I'm starting from zero with the goal of becoming a professional developer. All progress, mistakes and lessons will be documented here. This is where I stop overthinking and start doing. Let's build.
### Day 1 – May 11, 2025  
**What I did:**  
- Installed Python  
- Ran my first "Hello World" script
  
**What I learned:**  
- How to run a Python file from the terminal  
- That starting is scarier in the head than in reality
