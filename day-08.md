## 📅 Day 8 – May 18, 2025

**✅ What I did:**

- Studied strings in Python.
- Practiced string slicing, analysis, and transformation.
- Learned about methods like len(), count(), find(), replace(), upper(), lower(), capitalize(), title(), strip(), and join().

**❌ What I struggled with:**
- Couldn't solve the exercise about counting the number of letters in a full name (excluding spaces).
- Didn't know how to check if a word appears at the **beginning** of a string using `in`.

**📚 What I learned today:**
- Not everything clicks right away — and that’s okay. Some things need more time and practice.
- Getting stuck doesn’t mean failure; it means I’m learning.

### 🧠 Reflection:
Even though I couldn’t finish the exercises alone, I’m still proud I studied and reflected.  
I don’t want to pretend I did something I didn’t — this log is for my real progress.
