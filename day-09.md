## ðŸ“… Day 9 â€“ May 19, 2025

**âœ… What I did:**

Today I tackled more complex exercises that required analysis, fixing logic errors, and applying functions I had learned earlier. Although I couldnâ€™t solve everything, I made solid progress in understanding and execution.

**âœ… What I accomplished:**

- Solved the exercise of breaking down a number from 0 to 9999 into units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
  - I realized it wasnâ€™t necessary to convert the number to a list; I could access digits directly using indexes.
- Learned how to split a full name and get the first name using indexing.
- Used string splitting to check if a specific word appears at the beginning of an input.
- Refined my understanding of how to isolate parts of a string using `.split()` and indexing.
- Corrected my own logic errors without external help.
- I stayed honest with myself: if I didnâ€™t understand something, I didnâ€™t fake it.

**ðŸ¤” Questions and pending challenges:**

- How do I find the **last occurrence** of a specific letter (like `'a'`) in a sentence?
- How do I access the **last element** of a list without knowing how many elements there are (without hardcoding an index)?

### ðŸ§  Reflection:

Today was more challenging, but I stuck with it. I experienced the joy of solving a problem on my own. I felt a rush of excitement when I figured it out without external help, and I immediately wrote that feeling down in my notes. That moment showed me how powerful independent problem-solving can be. I also rewrote the entire lesson in my own words. This helped me organize and solidify everything I had learned about string manipulation. Rewriting wasn't just copying â€” it forced me to truly understand and reframe the knowledge. Iâ€™m starting to build real confidence, not from completing tasks quickly, but from understanding deeply. I no longer panic when I get stuck. I stay with the problem and trust myself to figure it out, even if it takes time.
