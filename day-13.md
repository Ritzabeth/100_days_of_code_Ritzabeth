## 📅 Day 13 – May 23, 2025

**✅ What I did:**


Today was a mix of success and challenge. I didn’t feel motivated to study at first, but I still managed to work through several Python exercises using conditional logic (`if/else`). Here’s what I covered:

**💻 Example Codes:**

- ✔️ **Exercise 35** – Checked if three given line segments can form a triangle using conditional logic.
  
  ```python
  a = int(input("First measure: "))
  b = int(input("Second measure: "))
  c = int(input("Third measure: "))
  if a+b > c and a+c > b and b+c > a:
      print("These lines CAN form a triangle.")
  else:
      print("These lines CANNOT form a triangle.")

✔️**Exercise 34** – Calculated salary increase based on the current salary value.

```
salary = float(input("Enter your current salary: "))
if salary > 1250:
    new_salary = salary + (salary * 10 / 100)
else:
    new_salary = salary + (salary * 15 / 100)
print(f"Your new salary is {new_salary:.2f}")
```
**❌ Exercise 33** – Tried to create a program to find the largest and smallest of 3 numbers using if/else.
However, it didn’t return the correct result. Will review the logic again later.

**📝 Notes**

- I didn't fully understand the logic for comparing three numbers with if/else only.
  
- I’ll revisit Exercise 33 tomorrow with more clarity.

- Even without full motivation, I didn’t give up completely today.
