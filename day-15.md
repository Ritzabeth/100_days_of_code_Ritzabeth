## ðŸ“… Day 15 â€“ May 25, 2025  

**âœ… What I did:**

Today was Sunday and I spent most of the day with my family. I didnâ€™t have much time or focus to study properly, but I still tried to stay connected to the process.

**ðŸ“š What I touched on:**

I briefly watched the beginning of a video about using ANSI escape sequences to add color to terminal outputs in Python.  
It talked about how to use codes like `\033[1;31m` to change the color of printed text â€” though I havenâ€™t gone deep into it yet.

### ðŸ’» Tiny Example (just to keep the spark):

```python
print("\033[1;31mThis is red text!\033[m")
