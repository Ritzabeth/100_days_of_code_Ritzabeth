## ðŸ“… Day 17 â€“ May 27, 2025  

**What happened:**

I couldnâ€™t code today due to electricity problems.  

### ðŸ§  Reflection:

Some things are out of my control, and thatâ€™s part of the journey too.  
What matters is that I keep going as soon as I can. Missing a day doesnâ€™t erase my progress â€” itâ€™s just a pause.
