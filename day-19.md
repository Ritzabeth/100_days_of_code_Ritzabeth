## ðŸ’» Day 19 â€“ May 29, 2025

**âœ… What I did:**

- Today, my study time was interrupted by a visit. I didnâ€™t get the chance to sit down and focus as I usually do. These things happen, and even though I didnâ€™t progress today, Iâ€™m still showing up and keeping the habit alive by logging the day. Not every day will be productive, but consistency means accepting that and moving forward anyway.

**Tomorrowâ€™s goal:**

- Pick up where I left off and do a focused session.
