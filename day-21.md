## ðŸ“… Day 21 â€“ May 31, 2025

**âœ… What I did:**

- Took the day off from studying â€” sometimes rest or a break is what I needed.
- Reflected on my progress so far and planned topics to review next week.
- Stayed mindful of the importance of consistency but accepted that skipping a day doesnâ€™t mean failure.

**ðŸ“š What I learned:**

- Taking breaks is part of the learning process, not a setback.
- Planning ahead after a rest day makes it easier to get back on track.
