## ðŸ“… Day 25 â€“ June 4, 2025

**âœ… What I did:**

- Studied the theory of for loops in Python for the first time.

**ðŸ“š What I learned:**

- *for* loops are used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

- The *range()* function helps define how many times the loop runs.

- A control variable (like i or x) keeps track of the current iteration.

**ðŸ’¡ Key concepts:**

- *for* loops are great when you already know how many times you want to repeat something.

The syntax follows this structure:
```
for variable in range(start, stop):
    # code to repeat
```
Example: range(0, 5) means it runs 5 times, from 0 to 4.

**ðŸ’» Example Code:**

```
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(f"This is repetition number {i}")
```
