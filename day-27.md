## ðŸ“… Day 27 â€“ June 6, 2025


**âœ… What I did:**

- Practiced several for loop exercises.
- Used range() in different ways, including countdowns and counting by 2s and 5s.
- Tried to sum even numbers entered by the user.
- Attempted a PA (progressÃ£o aritmÃ©tica).
- Started to understand how to check for prime numbers.
- Built a multiplication table script.

**ðŸ“š What I learned:**

- How to use range(start, stop, step) to control iterations.
- That sleep(1) can be used for countdown effects.
- The importance of clear conditional logic to avoid repeated or incorrect outputs.

**I'm still figuring out how to handle:**

- Showing only one result for prime check.
- Summing only odd numbers that are multiples of 3.
- Displaying the first 10 values of a PA correctly.


**ðŸ’» Example Code (Countdown Rocket):**

```
from time import sleep

for c in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(c)
    sleep(1)

print("\U0001f680")  # ðŸš€
```
