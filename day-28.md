## 📅 Day 28 – June 7, 2025

**✅ What I did:**

- Practiced the concept of indexes and how they work inside loops.
- Understood how Python accesses each element in a sequence one by one.
- Got an example of using a list with for to see index and value together.
- Talked about how loops relate to repetition and automation in code.

**💻 Example Code:**

```
lista = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, value in enumerate(lista):
    print(f"Index: {index} | Value: {value}")
```
**📚 What I learned:**

- A *for* loop can iterate over sequences like strings, lists, or numbers.
- The index is the position of an item in a list (starting from 0).
- *enumerate()* lets you get both index and value inside a loop.
- The value changes in each iteration, letting you do something with each one.

**⚠️ I’m still processing:**

- The deeper logic behind when to use range() vs. enumerate().
- How to build practical examples from scratch.
- How to explain what the loop is doing at each step.
