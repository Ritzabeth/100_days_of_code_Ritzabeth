## 📅 Day 31 – June 10, 2025

**✅ What I learned today:**

- I realized not all odd numbers are multiples of 3, which helped me correct mistakes in my thinking.
- I practiced comparing values using conditionals to count how many numbers are greater or smaller.

**❌ What I still don’t fully understand:**

- How to initialize and compare unknown values when trying to find the largest or smallest number.
- When and how to use None, accumulators (+=), and control structures properly.
- The difference between just writing code and actually thinking through what each line does.

**🚀 How I improved:**

- I developed more mental patience with logic problems and didn’t give up despite frustration.
- I asked deeper “why” questions to understand the logic behind the code.
- I’m getting better at spotting when something doesn’t make logical sense in the code.

**🔧 What I can improve:**

- Visualizing the code’s logic better before writing it — maybe sketching or walking through examples first.
- Explaining concepts in my own words to truly own what I learn.
