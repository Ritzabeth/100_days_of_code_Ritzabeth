## ðŸ“… Day 33 â€“ June 12, 2025

**âœ… What I did today:**
I procrastinated again. I didnâ€™t study or code.

###ðŸ’¬ Reflection:
Two slow days in a row. Iâ€™m not proud, but I wonâ€™t pretend either. This is part of the learning curve. What matters is not getting stuck here. Tomorrow is another chance to take a small step forward â€” even 15 minutes of focus can help me rebuild momentum.
