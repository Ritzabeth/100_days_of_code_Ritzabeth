ðŸ“… Day 37 â€“ June 16, 2025

**What I did (non-code progress):**

- I had a therapy session for the first time to take care of my mental and emotional health.

- I didnâ€™t study programming today, but I showed up for myself in a different way.

### ðŸ§  Reminder to future me:
Taking care of your mind is part of becoming a better developer.
