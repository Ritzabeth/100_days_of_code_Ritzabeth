## ðŸ“… Day 40 â€“ June 19, 2025

**âœ… What I did:**

- I explored methods and approaches on how to teach languages (not programming).

- My focus today shifted toward educational strategies and understanding learning processes.

- I wasnâ€™t able to study programming due to personal and psychological reasons.

### ðŸ§  Reflection:

Even though I didnâ€™t code today, I still engaged with learning and teaching â€” which are essential parts of becoming a better developer and communicator.
