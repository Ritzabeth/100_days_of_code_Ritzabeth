## 📅 Day 42 – June 22, 2025

**❌ What happened:**
- I forgot to update earlier and realized it’s already past 2 AM.
- I didn’t study programming today.
 I still showed up because showing up even when it's hard builds the kind of consistency that matters in the long run.

I turned on my laptop just to write this. That’s the level of respect I want to give this process.

### 🧠 Reflection:

I still showed up because showing up even when it's hard builds the kind of consistency that matters in the long run. I turned on my laptop just to write this. That’s the level of respect I want to give this process. Not every day has to be productive, but every day can be intentional.
