## ðŸ“… Day 44 â€“ June 24, 2025

**What happened today:**

I joined an animal adoption. I spent the whole day helping, organizing, and searching for solutions and potential adopters. It was a meaningful day, but I didnâ€™t have time or energy left to study programming.

**ðŸ’¬ Reflection:**

Contributing to causes I believe in is also part of the person I want to be â€” not just a programmer, but someone who uses tech and time for good.
