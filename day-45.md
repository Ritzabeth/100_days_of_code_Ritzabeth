## ðŸ“… Day 45 â€“ June 25, 2025

**What happened:**

Today I wasnâ€™t able to study or program. I faced moments of disrespect while trying to help, and also dealt with painful challenges in animal welfare efforts. It felt overwhelming. I didnâ€™t have the mental space to code, study, or even think clear. But I showed up with good intentions. I cared. I tried. And that counts.
